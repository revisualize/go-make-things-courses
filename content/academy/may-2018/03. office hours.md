Join weekly video office hours to ask questions, share work in progress, and get help with any big roadblocks.

Office hours are held at 12pm US Eastern time every Wednesday to accommodate as many students globally as possible. If you need help figuring out what time that is for you locally, checkout my [timezone calculator app](https://cferdinandi.github.io/timezones/).
