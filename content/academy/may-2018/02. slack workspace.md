As a member of the Vanilla JS Academy, you get access to a private Slack channel just for you and other students going through the program.

It's a place for you to collaborate with your fellow students, ask questions, share what youâ€™re learning, and get unstuck.

*Before the program starts, create an account, setup your profile, and introduce yourself. You're going to be working together for six weeks. Get to know one another.*
