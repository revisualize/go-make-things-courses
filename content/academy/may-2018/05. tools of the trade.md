All that you need to complete the Vanilla JS Academy and work on the projects is a modern web browser and a text editor.

Recommended Browsers
: The latest versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416), and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge) will all work just fine. Pick the one you're most comfortable with.

Recommended Text Editors
: My favorite text editor is [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but it costs $80. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft is a fantastic, 100% free text editor that works on any platform, and comes with a ton of useful features baked right in. I recommend it to all of my students.

Any else?
: All of the source code for the projects is posted on GitHub, but you don't need to know command line or Git to use it. You can download the files using the `Download Zip` button to get instant access to the project files.
