Use `getElementsByClassName()` to find all elements on a page that have a specific class or classes.

***Note:*** *This returns a live HTMLCollection of elements. If an element is added or removed from the DOM after you set your variable, the list is automatically updated to reflect the current DOM.*

```javascript
// Get elements with a class
var elemsByClass = document.getElementsByClassName('some-class');

// Get elements that have multiple classes
var elemsWithMultipleClasses = document.getElementsByClassName('some-class another-class');
```
