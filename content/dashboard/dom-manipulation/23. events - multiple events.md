In vanilla JavaScript, each event type requires it's own event listener. Unfortunately, you *can't* pass in multiple events to a single listener like you might in jQuery and other frameworks.

```javascript
// This won't work!

var btns = document.querySelectorAll('.click-me');

btns.addEventListener('click, scroll', function (event) {
    console.log(event); // The event details
    console.log(event.target); // The clicked element
}, false);
```

**But...** by using a named function and passing that into your event listener, you can avoid having to write the same code over and over again.

```javascript
// Setup our function to run on various events
var someFunction = function (event) {
	// Do something...
};

// Add our event listeners
window.addEventListener('click', someFunction, false);
window.addEventListener('scroll', someFunction, false);
```
