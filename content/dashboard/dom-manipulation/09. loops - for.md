In vanilla JavaScript, you use `for` to loop through array and node list items.

```javascript
var sandwiches = [
	'tuna',
	'ham',
	'turkey',
	'pb&j'
];

for (var i = 0; i < sandwiches.length; i++) {
	console.log(i) // index
	console.log(sandwiches[i]) // value
}

// returns 0, tuna, 1, ham, 2, turkey, 3, pb&j
```

- In the first part of the loop, before the first semicolon, we set a counter variable (typically `i`, but it can be anything) to `0`.
- The second part, between the two semicolons, is the test we check against after each iteration of the loop. In this case, we want to make sure the counter value is less than the total number of items in our array. We do this by checking the `.length` of our array.
- Finally, after the second semicolon, we specify what to run after each loop. In this case, we're adding `1` to the value of `i` with `i++`.

We can then use `i` to grab the current item in the loop from our array.

## Multiple loops on a page

Variables you set in the `for` part of the loop are not scoped to the loop, so if you tried to include a second loop with `var i` you would get an error. You can use a different variable, or define `var i` outside of the loop and set its value in the loop.

```javascript
for (var n = 0; n < sandwiches.length; n++) {
	// Do stuff...
}

// Or...
var i;
for (i = 0; i < sandwiches.length; i++) {
	// Do stuff...
}
```

## Skip and End

You can skip to the next item in a loop using `continue`, or end the loop altogether with `break`.

```javascript
for (var n = 0; n < sandwiches.length; n++) {

	// Skip to the next in the loop
	if (sandwiches[n] === 'ham') continue;

	// End the loop
	if (sandwiches[n] === 'turkey') break;

	console.log(sandwiches[n]);

}
```

## Browser Compatibility

Supported in all modern browsers, and at least back to IE6.
