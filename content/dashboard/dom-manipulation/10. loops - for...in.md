A `for...in` loop is a modified version of a `for` loop that you can use to loop through objects.

The first part, `key`, is a variable that gets assigned to the object key on each loop. The second part (in the example below, `lunch`), is the object to loop over.

We also want to check that the property belongs to this object, and isn't inherited from further up the object chain (for nested or *deep* objects). `if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key))` handles that for us.

Here's a working example.

```javascript
var lunch = {
	sandwich: 'ham',
	snack: 'chips',
	drink: 'soda',
	desert: 'cookie',
	guests: 3,
	alcohol: false,
};

for (var key in lunch) {
	if (lunch.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
		console.log(key); // key
		console.log(lunch[key]); // value
	}
}

// returns sandwich, ham, snack, chips, drink, soda, desert, cookie, guests, 3, alcohol, false
```
