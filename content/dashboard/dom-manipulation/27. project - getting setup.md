I've dropped some placeholder markup into the template to help you get started.

Each content area is shown or hidden using a simple anchor link. Each link has an `.accordion-toggle` class on it that we can use to target the links for styling and with JavaScript. The link's `href` points to the target content area.

Similarly, each content area is wrapped in a `<div>` with the `.accordion-content` class, and has a unique ID that matches the `href` of the toggle that shows or hides it.

```html
<a class="accordion-toggle" href="#content-1">Show More 1</a>

<div class="accordion-content" id="content-1">
	Content goes here...
</div>
```
