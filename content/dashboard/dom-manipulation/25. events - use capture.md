The last argument in `addEventListener()` is `useCapture`, and it specifies whether or not you want to "capture" the event. For most event types, this should be set to `false`. But certain events, like `focus`, don't bubble.

Setting `useCapture` to `true` allows you to take advantage of event bubbling for events that otherwise don't support it.

```javascript
// Listen for all focus events in the document
document.addEventListener('focus', function (event) {
	// Run functions whenever an element in the document comes into focus
}, true);
```
