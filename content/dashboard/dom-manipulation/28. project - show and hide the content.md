To make things really easy and gives us a ton of flexibility, we'll use some simple CSS to hide and show our content.

By default, we'll hide elements with the `.accordion-content` class using `display: none`. When someone clicks one of our toggle links, we'll add the `.active` class to the content, overriding it with `display: block` to make it visible.

***Note:*** *There are a ton of different naming conventions you can use for classes like this. Some prefer more state-driven classes like `.is-open` or `.is-active`. Use whatever works best for you.*

```css
.accordion-content {
	display: none;
}

.accordion-content.active {
	display: block;
}
```

An advantage of this approach is that if you have content you want to be open by default, you can add the `.active` class to it directly in the markup.

```html
<div class="accordion-content active" id="content-1">
	This content is visible on page load...
</div>
```
