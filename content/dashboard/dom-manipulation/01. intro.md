## A quick word about browser compatibility

This guide makes heavy use of ECMAScript 5 (more commonly known as ES5) and ECMA 6 (ES6) methods and APIs.

My goal for browser support is IE9 and above. Each function or technique mentioned in this guide includes specific browser support information. For methods and APIs that don't meet that standard, I also include information about polyfills&mdash;snippets of code that add support for features to browsers that donâ€™t natively offer it.

You'll never have to run a command line prompt, compile code, or learn a weird pseudo language (though you certain can if you want to).

*__Note:__ You can extend support all the way back to IE7 with a polyfill service like [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io)].*
