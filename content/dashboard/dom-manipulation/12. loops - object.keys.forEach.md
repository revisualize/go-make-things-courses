Strangely, there is no `Object.forEach()` method. The `Object.keys()` method returns an array of the keys in an object, and you can call the `Array.forEach()` method on that.

```javascript
var lunch = {
	sandwich: 'ham',
	snack: 'chips',
	drink: 'soda',
	desert: 'cookie',
	guests: 3,
	alcohol: false,
};

Object.keys(lunch).forEach(function (item) {
	console.log(item); // key
	console.log(lunch[item]); // value
});

// returns sandwich, ham, snack, chips, drink, soda, desert, cookie, guests, 3, alcohol, false
```

## Browser Compatibility

`Object.keys()` works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and above. You can push support back to at least IE6 by [adding this polyfill](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/objectkeys/), as well as the one for `Array.forEach()`.
