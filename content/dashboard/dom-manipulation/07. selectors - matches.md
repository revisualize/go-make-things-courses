Use `matches()` to check if an element would be selected by a particular selector or set of selectors. Returns `true` if the element is a  match, and `false` when it's not. This function is analogous to jQuery's `.is()` method.

```javascript
var elem = document.querySelector('#some-elem');
if (elem.matches('.some-class')) {
	console.log('It matches!');
} else {
	console.log('Not a match... =(');
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers, and IE9 and above.

**But...** several browser makes implemented it with nonstandard, prefixed naming. If you want to use it, you should include this [polyfill](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/polyfills/matches/) to ensure consistent behavior across browsers.
