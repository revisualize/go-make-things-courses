Selectors that target a specific element type, like `getElementById()` and `getElementsByClassName()`, are [more than twice as fast](https://jsperf.com/getelementbyid-vs-queryselector/25) as `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()`.

So, that's bad, right? I honestly don't think it matters.

`getElementById()` can run about 15 million operations a second, compared to *just* 7 million per second for `querySelector()` in the latest version of Chrome. But that also means that `querySelector()` runs 7,000 operations a millisecond. A millisecond. Let that sink in.

That's absurdly fast. Period.

Yes, `getElementById()` and `getElementsByClassName()` are faster. But the flexibility and consistency of `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()` make them the obvious muscle-memory choice for my projects.

They're not slow. They're just not *as* fast.
